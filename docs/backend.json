    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to manage users and their property listings in the Delhi Estate Luxe application. It leverages path-based ownership for properties to ensure security and ease of management. Specifically, each user has their own collection of properties under their user document. This enables secure `list` operations, as only the properties belonging to a specific user can be listed when querying `/users/{userId}/properties`. This design achieves authorization independence because access control to the `properties` subcollection is directly tied to the authenticated user's ID, without needing to fetch data from parent documents. This avoids hierarchical authorization dependencies and maintains atomicity during operations.  The structure facilitates straightforward security rules: only the authenticated user can create, read, update, or delete properties within their own `/users/{userId}/properties` collection."
